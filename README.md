The slip distribution models of the four earthquakes from 2015 to 2023 and the ΔCFS distribution of main faults in the Northern Pamir, and Southern Tien-Shan (NPST) region

The coseismic slip distribution models of the four earthquakes from 2015 to 2023 were stored in ".simp" format, with each little fault patch recorded as one row, each row containing ten elements, "lon(deg) lat(deg) str(deg) dip(deg) dep(km) wid(km) leng(km) s_slip(m) d_slip(m) o_slip(m) ". 

The ΔCFS distribution of main faults in the Northern Pamir were stored in ".gmt" format, which can plot directly by GMT.
